This is a gambling game based on the concept of socket programing in python language. It used the concept of sockets for interaction between client and server. We are taking input form client like 7up or 7down or 7 and in server side we are generating random number from a function and will comare that random from that clients input and will reduce or increase the amount of money for client accordingly.

TO RUN THE CODE :- 

For this we have to run the server by python server.py
then client by python client.py.
